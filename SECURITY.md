# Security

## Scope

This repository contains one bounded Intelligent Contract, direct tests, a five-validator GLSim test, and an opt-in StudioNet smoke test. It has no frontend, backend, database, token, payout, proxy upgrade, or repository secret.

## Trust model

Untrusted evidence is delimited as data, model outputs use closed schemas, and validator replay must agree before semantic state is stored.

The deployer is the author and controls beat setup, ending submission, the optional revision, and final adoption. Any address may cast one vote in the bounded three-reader round.

## Implemented controls

- Concrete immutable GenVM runner hash; no floating runner dependency.
- Address normalization, explicit role separation, collection caps, one-time actions, and lifecycle locks.
- Bounded text plus strict `[EXPECTED]` and `[LLM_ERROR]` failure classes.
- Sorted, delimited evidence packets and independent validator replay.
- Storage is copied before nondeterministic callbacks; static audit requires zero callback reads from `self`.
- No cross-contract calls, fund custody, transfer, automated purchase, external deletion, or webhook.
- `.env`, caches, artifacts, wallet files, and local secrets are ignored. Live wallets are encrypted outside the workspace.

## Contract-specific safety properties

- Required beats freeze before the author can submit an ending.
- A reader address can vote only once in a round, and resolution requires three votes.
- At most one revised ending can be submitted.
- AI does not judge literary quality and cannot force the author to adopt an ending.

## Residual risks

- Continuity is evaluated only against the stored setup, boundary, and beats.
- Reader votes are pseudonymous addresses and are not identity-verified audience research.
- The result is drafting feedback, not a copyright, authorship, or publication determination.

Do not use this contract to make legal, medical, financial, employment, admission, credit, or physical-safety decisions beyond the explicit low-risk policy in its source. A new use case requires a fresh deployment and independent domain review.

## Reporting

Report vulnerabilities privately to the repository owner with the contract name, affected method, reproduction, expected invariant, and impact. Never include private keys, wallet passwords, or personal data.
