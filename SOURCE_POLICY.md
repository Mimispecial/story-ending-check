# Source Policy

## Authoritative source collection

The stored story title and setup, continuity boundary, ordered required beats, and current ending version. No external manuscript or reference is fetched.

Those normalized on-chain values are the complete authoritative collection for consensus. A reviewer can reconstruct the exact packet without trusting a mutable external page.

## No autonomous retrieval

This contract performs no HTTP request, web search, URL rendering, oracle lookup, file download, or hidden enrichment. A URL, filename, checksum, or source label inside user text remains an untrusted declaration; validators are not asked to open it.

## Collection responsibility

The deployer and participants must provide complete, lawfully usable, non-secret material. On-chain storage proves which normalized bytes were considered; it does not prove authorship, completeness, ownership, provenance, or real-world truth.

## Normalization and limits

Text inputs normalize CRLF or CR to LF, trim surrounding whitespace, and enforce field-specific minimum and maximum lengths. Collection sizes and revision loops are capped. Model output uses closed categories, fixed-order masks, or compact codes and fails closed on extra, missing, malformed, or out-of-range values.

## Prompt-injection boundary

Evidence is serialized as sorted JSON and surrounded by named START/END delimiters. The prompt states that the packet is data, never instructions. Each validator independently replays the assessment before a result can enter state.

## Interpretation boundary

Continuity is evaluated only against the stored setup, boundary, and beats. Reader votes are pseudonymous addresses and are not identity-verified audience research. Applications must disclose these limits beside results and use a fresh deployment when the authoritative source collection or policy changes.
